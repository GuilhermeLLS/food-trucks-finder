## What's this application

This is the frontend application for the Food Facilities Challenge. It provides a user interface for managing and viewing food facilities data, allowing users to interact with the backend API in an intuitive way.

- React Router v7
- Tailwind CSS
- Vitest
- shadcn-ui
- Biome

## How to run

1. Install recommended extensions:
   - Biome extension for your editor
   - TypeScript editor extensions

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following content:

   ```
   VITE_BACKEND_HOST=http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Folder Structure

The project follows the default React Router structure with some specific organization:

```
src/
├── routes/           # Contains all route definitions in a single file
├── components/       # Contextualized components
│   ├── ui/          # Design system generic elements (shadcn + custom)
│   ├── home/        # Components specific to the home route
│   ├── facilities/  # Components specific to the facilities route
│   └── ...          # Other route-specific component folders
```

Each route-specific folder contains components that are only used by that particular route, making the codebase more maintainable and organized. The `ui` folder contains reusable design system components, including those generated by shadcn-ui and custom components created for the project.
